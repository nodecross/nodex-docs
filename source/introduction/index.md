# Introduction

While Internet of Thing (IoT) brings new business opportunities to all industries and sectors, it also introduces cybersecurity risks. In recent years, cyber attacks targeting endpoint devices and data in motion on IoT systems have increased rapidly. Traditional perimeter defenses alone cannot prevent such threats; identity centric security is essential for modern distributed systems comprised of IoT and microservices.

When building identity first security for IoT systems, the massive upfront cost and operational burden are major challenges. It is often difficult to retrofit security measures on devices, so even before design stage, IoT developers need to consider and build security infrastructure from edge to cloud, such as device's identity and key management, mutual authentication, end-to-end encryption, dynamic access control, security update after market and so on. It requires a highly expertise and massive budget and is a major barrier to introduce security into all IoT systems.

NodeX is building future where machines own their identity and exchange verifiable data across all digital interactions. Our open-source security infrastructure is standards-compliant, production-ready, and extensible into any type of devices. This documentation offers ways of getting started with NodeX projects.

## What's NodeX?

NodeX is an open-source toolkit that enables any developers to connect all devices and clouds, using features of decentralized identifiers as a basis of security and privacy. At a high level, the core components in NodeX are as follows;

- **NodeX Agent**: An open-source Agent that integrates into devices.
- **NodeX Studio**: An integrated monitoring tool that enables NodeX Agent to monitor integrated devices and aims to improve the efficiency of DevOps for IoT devices.
- **NodeX Network**: A distributed network that operates public key certificates (DID Documents) of Agents.

As figure 1, you can launch your NodeX Hub and set up access policy, and integrate NodeX Agent into your devices or clouds. You can easily build a security infrastructure that connects all your devices to the cloud with NodeX.

### NodeX Agent

An open-source Rust library that is extensible into any type of devices. Currently supported OS is Linux Kernel x86 (32bit), Linux Kernel x86-64 (64 bit), and FreeRTOS. The core components are as follows;

- **Device Identity Management**: This component supports generating a global unique device identifier in compliance with a W3C Decentralized Identifiers Standard ([Decentralized Identifiers v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)).
- **Key Management with RoT**: This component supports generating key pairs within the device and protect private keys with hardware security module, such as TPM2.0, TrustZone, Secure Crypto Engine.
- **Automated Provisioning**: This component supports registering and operating public key certificate (DID Document) generation, resolve, renewal, and revocation on a decentralized PKI without any IdPs, CAs, and intermediators.
- **Policy Management**: This component allows security-relevant configuration changes through an authorized NodeX Hub. It has access policy file (IPs, DIDs, endpoints), security policy file (security parameter, pre-shared-key) and update policy (logging transmission frequency).
- **RoT Extension**: This component can be applied to RoTs with proprietary specifications by implementing shared libraries according to the API specification.
- **Device Extension**: This library can be distributed as middleware for IPC communication with client applications or as a library to be integrated into client application.
- **Message Encryption/Decryption**: To enable encrypted messages to be sent and received between devices, NodeX Agent provides message encryption and decryption.

### NodeX Studio

Integrated device monitoring tool that integrates NodeX Agent for device authentication, access policy management, Agent data logging and visualization.

- **Device IAM**: This component supports device authentication based on digital signature scheme (256-bit ECDSA) rather than username and password.
- **Device Authenticity**: This component supports verifying the device authenticity by message authentication code generated by the pre-shared secret between Agent and Studio.
- **Inventory Management**: This component supports managing a configuration file which stores authorized device DIDs and attributions.
- **Device Knowledge Database**: This component supports storing and real-time tracking device communication logs for vital checks and threat detection.
- **Data Loss Prevention**: This component prevents devices from sending data or receiving data from unauthorized clouds by enforcing access policies.
- **Dynamic Access Control**: This component supports dynamically changing access policies based on device's identity, location, and behavior to prevent spoofing and unauthorized access

### NodeX Network

NodeX Network consists of a [sidetree protocol](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/) for creating scalable DIDs networks that can run atop any existing decentralized anchoring system and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying anchoring systems they utilize. The protocol allows users to create globally unique identifiers and manage their associated PKI metadata, all without the need for centralized authorities or trusted third parties.

NodeX Agent generates multiple key pairs from a hardware-derived true random number generator (TRNG) within the RoT secure processing environment, and generates a payload including public keys for registering with NodeX Network to create a DID document binding decentralized identifier and the public key. Anyone can obtain the corresponding device's public key from the distributed network to authenticate the device and verify the digitally signed data.
