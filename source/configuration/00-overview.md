# Overview

Settings in NodeX can be broadly categorized into three types. The first is **Initial configuration**, the second is **System configuration**, and the third is **User configuration**.

**Initial configuration**<br />
The initial settings are those required to use the NodeX Agent. It mainly allows you to configure the essential behavior of the NodeX Agent itself.

**System configuration**<br />
The system settings are generated and managed autonomously by the Agent itself, and are necessary for NodeX to work, and cannot be changed by the system or application in which the NodeX Agent is embedded.

**Network configuration**<br />
Network settings are used to control the direction of communication between Agents and Agent's HeartBeat settings.This is future release.

**Update configuration**<br />
Some settings can be updated from NodeX Studio. This is future release.
