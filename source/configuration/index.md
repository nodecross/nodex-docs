# Configuration

This section describes the configuration of NodeX, which offers two types of agents: an application type that can be run directly on the OS, and an SDK type that can be embedded directly into your system. Although the agents are provided in different ways, the settings that can be configured for each agent are the same, and the only difference is how the agent is configured. This section provides an overview of what can be configured for NodeX agents and how to configure each agent type.
