# Initial Configuration

Initial configuration items in NodeX include the following:

- **TPM Settings**
    - TRNG Settings
    - Datastore Settings
    - Configuration Encryption Settings
- **Authentication Settings**
    - Project DID
    - Project Secret

These values can be set in command line options or environment variables that can be specified when running the NodeX Agent to modify its behavior.

## TPM Settings

**TRNG Settings**<br />
A TRNG is a true random number generator, which allows you to inject a method to supply random numbers to the NodeX Agent. If the method is not injected, the built-in processing in the NodeX Agent will generate random numbers using the OS pseudo-random number generator.

**Datastore Settings**<br />
Methods can be injected into the process of storing and retrieving the private key generated by the NodeX Agent. For example, it is possible to implement a process to save the private key to the TPM's built-in secure storage area. If the method is not injected, the NodeX Agent will encode the private key in Base64 format and save it in the configuration file.

**Configuration Encryption Settings**<br />
When NodeX reads or writes system and user settings, it can inject methods for encryption and decryption processes. If the method is not injected, the NodeX Agent reads and writes configuration information in plain text format using the built-in processing in the NodeX Agent.

## Authentication Settings
Project DID and Project Secret are the NodeX Agent needs to communicate with other DID-assigned Agents. As mentioned earlier, the NodeX Agent works together with the NodeX HUB as a relay node, and Project DID and Project Secret are necessary information when registering the Agent with the NodeX HUB. These will be notified by CollaboGate Japan after the contract is signed.
