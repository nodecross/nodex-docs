# Interface Definitions

This chapter defines the API interface required for development when replacing or extending the RoT functionality of NodeX Agent to your own specifications. The development procedure is to build a shared library that implements your own processing based on the interface definitions shown below, and place it in a designated location accessible by NodeX Agent. NodeX Agent loads shared libraries at startup, overriding some core NodeX Agent functions with processes provided as shared libraries.

## True random number generation

```
Method: nodex_err_t nodex_read_trng(void *result_ptr)
```

This is implemented when replacing the process of generating true random numbers. Accesses its own TRNG module inside the shared library, and links true random numbers to NodeX Agent through a pointer. The return value of the method follows the definition of nodex_err_t.

## Save private keys

```
Method: nodex_err_t nodex_write_private_key(char *private_key)
```

Implement this when replacing the private key storage process. The private key is stored inside the shared library using a proprietary cipher, etc. The return value of the method follows the definition of nodex_err_t. The return value of the method follows the definition of nodex_err_t.

## Find private keys

```
Method: nodex_err_t nodex_read_private_key(void *result_ptr)
```

This function is implemented when the process of reading out the private key is replaced. The private key is read out using a unique cipher or other device inside the shared library, and the private key is linked to the NodeX Agent through a pointer. The return value of the method follows the definition of nodex_err_t.

## Encryption Data

```
Method: nodex_err_t nodex_encrypt_message(char *message, void *result_ptr)
```

(TBD)

## Decryption Data

```
Method: nodex_err_t nodex_decrypt_message(char *message, void *result_ptr)
```

(TBD)
