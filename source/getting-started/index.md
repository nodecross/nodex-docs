# Getting Started

Try an example of sending a message via a NodeX Agent and receiving it.

## Installing NodeX Agent and set up

First. We setup NodeX Agent.
A tutorial without cloning the NodeX repository is currently in preparation.

Before running following commands, please install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

In the commands below, use the project secret key and project DID provided by CollaboGate Japan, Inc.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:nodecross/nodex.git
$ cd /path/to/nodex
$ cargo run -- --config network set --key secret_key --value <YOUR PROJECT SECRET KEY>
$ cargo run -- --config network set --key project_did --value <YOUR PROJECT DID>
```

```{note}
After configuring the agent, it typically takes approximately 30 minutes for the registration to be completed in the decentralized anchoring system. 
During this time, messages can't be sent and received. Kindly wait for a while and then spin up the agent.
```

## How to Send Messages in NodeX

In this section, you will see where you can use NodeX to send and receive messages addressed to you.

### Requirements

- Please set up NodeX Agent before the below action.
- This section uses node.js. So, please install it.

1. Check your own DID.

```sh
$ cat ~/.config/nodex/config.json | grep did
```

2. Wake up NodeX Agent.

```sh
$ cd /path/to/nodex
# Run nodex Agent
$ cargo run
```

3. Run receive message example. The original code is **[here](https://github.com/nodecross/nodex/tree/9bbcf0f6bcb6d0b487df7ed8368e347612053f27/examples/nodejs/cli)**.

The following is part of the example code.

```js
const URL = "ws+" + base + ":/receive";
console.log("connecting to " + URL);
const socket = new WebSocket(URL);

console.log("socket connected");
socket.on("open", () => {
  console.log("socket opened");
});

socket.on("message", (data) => {
  console.log("socket received: " + data);
  const message = JSON.parse(data.toString());
  const response = {
    message_id: message.message_id,
  };
  socket.send(JSON.stringify(response));
});

// close the socket after 30 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("closing socket");
  socket.close();
}, 30000);
```

Execute the following commands.

```shell
$ cd /path/to/nodex/examples/nodejs
$ yarn receive
```

4. Send a message to you via NodeX. This example sends some JSON messages. The original code is [here](https://github.com/nodecross/nodex/blob/develop/examples/nodejs/src/transfer.ts).

The following is part of the example code.

```js
(async () => {
  const json = await post("/transfer", {
    destinations: ["<add your did>"],
    messages: [
      {
        string: "value",
        number: 1,
        boolean: true,
        array: [],
        map: {},
      },
      {
        string: "value",
        number: 1,
        boolean: true,
        array: [],
        map: {},
      },
    ],
    metadata: {
      string: "value",
      number: 1,
      boolean: true,
      array: [],
      map: {},
    },
  });

  console.log(json);
})();
```

Execute the following commands.

```sh
$ cd /path/to/nodex/examples/nodejs
$ yarn transfer
```

5. Check the example applicationâ€™s log
   You will see the following logs.
