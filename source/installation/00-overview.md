# Overview

The NodeX agent is currently available as a pre-built binary download from the release page in the GitHub repository. In the future, we are working on making it easier for developers to install the agent by using the distribution's official package management system to provide a better installation and development experience.

It is currently confirmed to work under Ubuntu, Debian, Yocto, and macOS.
Future plans include providing pre-built binaries for Windows. In addition, we plan to provide C/C++/Rust SDK for Linux/macOS and C/C++ SDK for RTOS (FreeRTOS, AzureRTOS).

Currently, NodeX officially offers the following types of pre-built binaries.

- Linux (x86_64)
- macOS (x86_64)

It is also possible to build and install from source code instead of pre-built binaries.
