# Overview

The NodeX agent is currently available as a pre-built binary download from the release page in the GitHub repository. In the future, we are working on making it easier for developers to install the agent by using the distribution's official package management system to provide a better installation and development experience.

Future plans include providing pre-built binaries for WindowsOS. In addition, we plan to provide C/C++/Rust SDK for LinuxOS/WindowsOS/macOS and C/C++ SDK for RTOS (FreeRTOS, AzureRTOS).

Currently, NodeX officially offers the following types of pre-built binaries.

- Linux OS (x86_64)
- Mac OS (x86_64)

It is also possible to build and install from source code instead of pre-built binaries.
