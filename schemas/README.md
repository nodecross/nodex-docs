## Verifiable Credential Data

This document contains the suggested specification for Verifiable Credential data, referred to as `crednetialSubject` property in the VC data model. In general, these schemas are based on [schema.org](https://schema.org/docs/full.html) base types such as [Person](https://schema.org/Person) and [Organization](https://schema.org/Organization), with custom extensions for new concepts not described by schema.org.
